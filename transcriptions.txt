You have a doctor appointment at 3 PM today?

Yes, that's correct.

Have you prepared all the necessary documents?

I have my ID and insurance card ready. Is there anything else I need?

Maybe bring a list of any medications you're taking.

That's a good idea. I’ll write them down now.

Also, it might be useful to jot down any questions you have for the doctor.

I have a few things I want to ask. I'll make sure to note them.

Do you need any help getting there?

No, I can manage. I’ll take the bus.

Alright, just make sure to leave early enough to avoid any delays.

I will. Thanks for the reminder.

No problem. Let me know how it goes afterwards.

I will. Thanks for your help!
